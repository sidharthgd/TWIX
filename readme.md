# TWIX: Reconstructing Structured Data from Templatized Documents

[![Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-arXiv-red)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06659)

TWIX is a tool for automatically extracting strucutred data from templatized documents that are programmatically generated by populating fields in a visual template. TWIX reverse-engineers the underlying template, and then perform data extraction.  

1. A Python package for running production pipelines from the Python code
2. By default, TWIX offers end-to-end APIs that enable direct extraction of structured data from PDFs without requiring labels  
3. TWIX allows users to interactively modify the predicted template to improve data extraction
4. TWIX is 700x faster, 5,000x cheaper, and 25% more accurate than GPT-4 Vision for extracting information from a large document collection with 817 pages

## üöÄ Getting Started

If you want to use TWIX as a Python package:

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or later
- OpenAI API key

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ucbepic/docetl.git
```

2. Install packages. 

```bash
pip install -e . 
```

Set OpenAI API key as environment variable

[You can refer to this document](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety)



1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ucbepic/docetl.git
cd docetl
```

1. Set up environment variables in `.env` in the root/top-level directory:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BACKEND_ALLOW_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
BACKEND_HOST=localhost
BACKEND_PORT=8000
BACKEND_RELOAD=True
FRONTEND_HOST=0.0.0.0
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
```

And create an .env.local file in the `website` directory with the following:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini

NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_HOST=localhost
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_PORT=8000
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
make install      # Install Python package
make install-ui   # Install UI dependencies
```

Note that the OpenAI API key, base, and model name are for the UI assistant only; not the DocETL pipeline execution engine.

4. Start the development server:
```bash
make run-ui-dev
```

5. Visit http://localhost:3000/playground to access the interactive UI.

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

If you're planning to contribute or modify DocETL, you can verify your setup by running the test suite:

```bash
make tests-basic  # Runs basic test suite (costs < $0.01 with OpenAI)
```
