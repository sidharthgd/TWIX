URL:https://www.hearst.com/-/hearst-television-broadcast-terms-conditions
Notwithstanding to whom bills are rendered, advertiser, agency and service, jointly and severally, shall remain obligated to pay to station the amount of any bills rendered by station within the time specified and until
payment in full is received by station. Payment by advertiser to agency or to service or payment by agency to service, shall not constitute payment to station. Station will not be bound by conditions, printed or
otherwise, on contracts, insertion orders, copy instructions or any correspondence when such conflict with the above terms and conditions. Four weeks advance cancellation notice is required unless otherwise
specified.
Station, and its parent company, does not discriminate in the sale of advertising time, and will accept no advertising which is placed with an intent to discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity. Advertiser hereby

stations on the basis of race or ethnicity.
